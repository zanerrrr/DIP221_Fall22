            Cats have earned the respect. They are known for their spiky claws and strong teeth. <strong> Did you know that cats do not get cavities? </strong> 
            Now you would likle to be a cat yourself. <br><br>
            Even though not everyone likes cats, they just don't really care. The reason why cats have been so loved through the centuries of human history is unknow.

        <h2><strong>But why is my cat so cute?</strong></h2>
        <p>This is also rather unsolvable mystery.</p>
        <p><em>But I know for sure that I love him dearly and I will forgive him all the mischief and nonsense that he sometimes do.</em></p>
        <p>My cat's name ir Minkāns. But I also call him Minka, Minčis or Resnis. He likes to eat, sleep, play and purr.</p>
