          <p>Since the anciet times in Egypt, cats have been one of the most royal animals in the world. And since then they have been loved and respected and have become the most popular pet.</p>
          <p>They have earned the people respect. Even though not everyone likes cats, they just don't really care. The reason why cats have been so loved through the centuries of human history is unknow.
            Maybe there's come kind of connection between the ancient Egypt and Cleopatra or the fact that cats are royal and unforgivable balls of cuteness.</p>
        <h2><strong>But why is my cat so cute?</strong></h2>
        <p>This is also rather unsolvable mystery.</p>
        <p><em>But I know for sure that I love him dearly and I will forgive him all the mischief and nonsense that he sometimes do.</em></p>
        <p>My cat's name ir Minkāns. But I also call him Minka, Minčis or Resnis. He likes to eat, sleep, play and purr.</p>
